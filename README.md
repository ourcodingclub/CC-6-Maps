# CC-6-Maps
Using R to produce map figures and display spatial data

This repository contains the files necessary to complete the first Coding Club R Markdown tutorial - you can check it out at https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/25/maps_tutorial.html

The bird data (`Gyps_rueppellii_GBIF.csv`, `Spheniscus_dermersus_GBIF.csv`) were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) https://www.gbif.org.

The trout data (`Brown_Trout_GBIF_clip.csv`) were downloaded from GBIF and modified by removing unnecessary columns.

The Freshwater Ecoregions shapefile (`FEOW-TNC`) was downloaded from http://www.feow.org

`ggmap_Cheatsheet.pdf` and `Coord_Ref_Systems.pdf` were downloaded from the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/
